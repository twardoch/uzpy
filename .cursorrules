## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core System Architecture (Importance: 95)
uzpy implements an automated Python construct usage tracker through a four-phase pipeline:
- Discovery phase locates Python files using Tree-sitter
- Parsing phase extracts construct definitions and docstrings 
- Analysis phase identifies usage patterns with hybrid Rope/Jedi approach
- Modification phase updates docstrings while preserving formatting

## Key Business Components (Importance: 90)

### Hybrid Analysis Engine 
Located in `src/uzpy/analyzer/hybrid_analyzer.py`
- Combines Rope and Jedi analyzers for comprehensive usage detection
- Implements confidence scoring to resolve conflicting results
- Handles complex cases like inheritance and dynamic imports

### Smart Docstring Management
Located in `src/uzpy/modifier/libcst_modifier.py`
- Preserves existing code formatting during updates
- Maintains "Used in:" sections with reference tracking
- Implements lossless docstring transformation logic

### Construct Parser
Located in `src/uzpy/parser/tree_sitter_parser.py`
- Extracts function, class and method definitions
- Processes docstrings and module-level documentation
- Handles syntax errors through error recovery

## Business Data Flow (Importance: 85)

### Reference Tracking
- Builds inverted indices for symbol lookup
- Maintains graph representation of usage relationships
- Stores confidence scores for analyzed references

### Validation Rules
- Graceful failure handling for parse/analysis errors
- Scope resolution using AST and symtable combination
- Usage verification through multi-analyzer consensus

## Integration Points (Importance: 75)

### File Processing Pipeline
- Respects gitignore patterns during discovery
- Implements parallel file processing capabilities
- Maintains cached ASTs with timestamp validation

### Documentation Updates
- Appends usage information to existing docstrings
- Preserves comment structure and formatting
- Handles multi-line and complex docstring formats
