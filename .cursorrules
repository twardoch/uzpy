# When you write code

- Iterate gradually, avoiding major changes
- Minimize confirmations and checks
- Preserve existing code/structure unless necessary
- Use constants over magic numbers
- Check for existing solutions in the codebase before starting
- Check often the coherence of the code you’re writing with the rest of the code.
- Focus on minimal viable increments and ship early
- Write explanatory docstrings/comments that explain what and WHY this does, explain where and how the code is used/referred to elsewhere in the code
- Analyze code line-by-line
- Handle failures gracefully with retries, fallbacks, user guidance
- Address edge cases, validate assumptions, catch errors early
- Let the computer do the work, minimize user decisions
- Reduce cognitive load, beautify code
- Modularize repeated logic into concise, single-purpose functions
- Favor flat over nested structures
- Consistently keep, document, update and consult the holistic overview mental image of the codebase. 

## Keep track of paths

In each source file, maintain the up-to-date `this_file` record that shows the path of the current file relative to project root. Place the `this_file` record near the top of the file, as a comment after the shebangs, or in the YAML Markdown frontmatter.

## When you write Python

- Use `uv pip`, never `pip`
- Use `python -m` when running code
- PEP 8: Use consistent formatting and naming
- Write clear, descriptive names for functions and variables
- PEP 20: Keep code simple and explicit. Prioritize readability over cleverness
- Use type hints in their simplest form (list, dict, | for unions)
- PEP 257: Write clear, imperative docstrings
- Use f-strings. Use structural pattern matching where appropriate
- ALWAYS add "verbose" mode logugu-based logging, & debug-log
- For CLI Python scripts, use fire & rich, and start the script with

```
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run -s
# /// script
# dependencies = ["PKG1", "PKG2"]
# ///
# this_file: PATH_TO_CURRENT_FILE
```

Work in rounds: 

- Create `PLAN.md` as a detailed flat plan with `[ ]` items. 
- Identify the most important TODO items, and create `TODO.md` with `[ ]` items. 
- Implement the changes. 
- Update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` as you go. 
- After each round of changes, update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes.
- Update `README.md` to reflect the changes.

Ask before extending/refactoring existing code in a way that may add complexity or break things.

When you’re finished, print "Wait, but" to go back, think & reflect, revise & improvement what you’ve done (but don’t invent functionality freely). Repeat this. But stick to the goal of "minimal viable next version". Lead two experts: "Ideot" for creative, unorthodox ideas, and "Critin" to critique flawed thinking and moderate for balanced discussions. The three of you shall illuminate knowledge with concise, beautiful responses, process methodically for clear answers, collaborate step-by-step, sharing thoughts and adapting. If errors are found, step back and focus on accuracy and progress.

## After Python changes run:

```
fd -e py -x autoflake {}; fd -e py -x pyupgrade --py311-plus {}; fd -e py -x ruff check --output-format=github --fix --unsafe-fixes {}; fd -e py -x ruff format --respect-gitignore --target-version py311 {}; python -m pytest;
```

Be creative, diligent, critical, relentless & funny!

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Business Logic Organization

The technical architecture centers around advanced video synchronization and overlay capabilities organized into three primary domains:

### Frame Analysis Domain
Controls video frame fingerprinting and comparison using a multi-algorithm perceptual hashing system:
- pHash for frequency domain features 
- AverageHash/ColorMomentHash for color attributes
- MarrHildrethHash for structural elements
- Weighted similarity scoring system

### Synchronization Domain  
Manages temporal video alignment through:
- Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with monotonic constraints
- Frame mapping and interpolation system
- Adaptive keyframe density calculation
- Background video retiming logic

### Composition Domain
Handles video merging operations focusing on:
- Foreground frame preservation rules
- Background adaptation policies
- Edge blending systems
- Audio stream selection logic

## Business Rules

1. Video Processing Rules
- Preserve all foreground video frames without modification
- Dynamically adapt background timing to match foreground
- Select audio source based on foreground availability
- Ensure frame-accurate synchronization

2. Synchronization Policies
- Prevent temporal drift through global alignment
- Handle mismatched frame rates and resolutions
- Support specialized border detection mode
- Enable configurable edge blending

## Domain Integration

The domains integrate through a pipeline architecture:
1. Frame Analysis provides similarity metrics
2. Synchronization uses metrics to determine optimal alignment
3. Composition applies alignment to generate final output
