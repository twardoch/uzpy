## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


### Core Business Logic Organization

1. Three-Phase Analysis Pipeline (Importance: 95)
- Discovery and indexing of code constructs
- Cross-reference finding using hybrid analyzer
- Docstring modification with usage information
File: `src/uzpy/pipeline.py`

2. Hybrid Analysis Engine (Importance: 90)
- Combines Rope for inheritance/import analysis
- Uses Jedi for fast symbol resolution
- Confidence scoring system for reference accuracy
File: `src/uzpy/analyzer/hybrid_analyzer.py`

3. Docstring Management (Importance: 85)
- Custom docstring transformation logic
- "Used in:" section management 
- Preservation of existing formatting
File: `src/uzpy/modifier/libcst_modifier.py`

4. Reference Storage System (Importance: 80)
- Hybrid data structure combining inverted indices with graphs
- Incremental update tracking using checksums
- Fast symbol lookup optimization
File: `src/uzpy/storage/reference_index.py`

### Domain-Specific Components

1. Custom Discovery Logic (Importance: 75)
- Configurable exclusion patterns
- Gitignore integration
- Project-specific file filtering
File: `src/uzpy/discovery.py`

2. Symbol Resolution (Importance: 70)
- Conservative analysis approach
- Fallback mechanisms for complex cases
- Scope tracking with symtable integration
File: `src/uzpy/symbol_resolver.py`

3. Visualization System (Importance: 65)
- Dependency graph generation
- Relationship analysis
- Auto-layout for complex codebases
File: `src/uzpy/visualization.py`

### Business Integration Points

1. Development Workflow Integration (Importance: 60)
- Watch mode for real-time updates
- Language Server Protocol support
- CI/CD hooks for documentation
File: `src/uzpy/integration.py`

2. Error Recovery System (Importance: 55)
- Graceful degradation logic
- Partial processing capabilities
- Detailed error reporting
File: `src/uzpy/error_handler.py`
