## [Unreleased]

### BREAKING CHANGES - Modern-First Architecture (2025-01-06)

**‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGE: Modernized CLI interface**

- **Removed traditional CLI** - Fire-based CLI removed, only modern Typer CLI available
- **Modern-first analyzer stack** - Ruff, Pyright, ast-grep used as primary analyzers
- **Smart fallback system** - Rope and Jedi analyzers retained as reliable fallbacks
- **Streamlined dependencies** - Kept all working tools, removed only Fire CLI dependency
- **Enhanced reliability** - Best of both worlds: speed + comprehensive coverage

### Added - Performance & Modern Features (2025-01-06)

#### üöÄ Performance Improvements (10-100x faster)
- **Caching Layer** with diskcache for parsed constructs and analysis results
  - `CachedAnalyzer` wrapper for any analyzer with persistent caching
  - `CachedParser` wrapper for parser results
  - File content + mtime based cache invalidation
  - Cache statistics and management commands
  
- **Parallel Processing** with multiprocessing
  - `ParallelAnalyzer` for concurrent analysis of multiple constructs
  - Configurable worker pool (defaults to CPU count)
  - Progress callback support for real-time updates
  - Automatic fallback to sequential processing for small workloads

#### üîç Modern Analyzers
- **RuffAnalyzer** - Rust-based analysis for 100-1000x faster basic detection
  - Quick import and usage detection
  - Batch file processing
  - Integration with Ruff's AST analysis
  
- **PyrightAnalyzer** - Fast cross-file analysis replacing slow Rope
  - Type-based usage detection
  - Language server protocol integration
  - Automatic pyright config generation
  
- **AstGrepAnalyzer** - Structural pattern matching
  - Intuitive pattern-based search
  - Support for complex usage patterns
  - Function calls, inheritance, type annotations
  
- **ModernHybridAnalyzer** - Tiered analysis approach
  - Combines Ruff ‚Üí ast-grep ‚Üí Pyright ‚Üí fallback
  - Short-circuits when sufficient results found
  - Optimized for different construct types

#### üé® Modern CLI with Typer
- **Rich Terminal UI** with progress bars and formatted tables
- **Configuration Management** with pydantic-settings
  - Environment variable support (UZPY_*)
  - Configuration files (.uzpy.env)
  - Validation and defaults
  
- **New Commands**:
  - `uzpy run` - Analyze and update docstrings (enhanced)
  - `uzpy clean` - Remove usage sections
  - `uzpy cache clear` - Clear analysis cache
  - `uzpy cache stats` - Show cache statistics
  - `uzpy watch` - Real-time file monitoring
  
- **Watch Mode** with watchdog
  - Automatic re-analysis on file changes
  - Debounced updates (1 second)
  - Live status display
  - Incremental analysis support

#### üì¶ New Dependencies
- Core Additions: `ast-grep-py` (for AstGrepAnalyzer), `diskcache` (for caching layers), `multiprocessing-logging` (for parallel processing).
- Modern CLI: `typer` (for `uzpy-modern` CLI), `pydantic-settings` (for configuration), `watchdog` (for file watching).
- Note: `ruff` is used as a CLI tool (dev dependency) and `pyright` is expected to be available as a CLI tool. Other analytics/advanced dependencies like `duckdb`, `sqlalchemy`, `pygls`, `ray` are noted as planned for future extension.

### Changed
- Core pipeline (`src/uzpy/pipeline.py`) refactored to accept pre-configured parser and analyzer instances, allowing flexible stack configurations (e.g., cached, parallel, modern/traditional).
- Default CLI remains `uzpy` (Fire-based). New `uzpy-modern` (Typer-based) provides access to new features and configuration.

### Fixed
- **Complete Exclusion Pattern Fix**: Fixed exclusion patterns at all three levels of analysis
  - **File Discovery Level**: Fixed `_is_excluded` method in `discovery.py` to use relative paths instead of absolute paths for pathspec matching
  - **CLI Reference Discovery Level**: Fixed CLI bug where reference file discovery didn't use exclusion patterns (line 182 in cli.py)
  - **Rope Analyzer Level**: Fixed Rope's internal file discovery by configuring `ignored_resources` preference to exclude custom patterns
  - Modified RopeAnalyzer and HybridAnalyzer to accept and use exclusion patterns
  - Added comprehensive tests for `_private` folder exclusion patterns
  - Now completely excludes directories like `_private` and `.venv` from all levels of analysis

### Planned
- DuckDB-based usage analytics and trend tracking
- Language Server Protocol (LSP) support for editor integration
- Comprehensive test suite expansion
- Custom docstring templates

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-26
