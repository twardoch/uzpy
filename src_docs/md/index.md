# uzpy: Python Code Usage Tracker & Docstring Updater

**uzpy** (`ÊŒzpi`) is a powerful command-line tool and Python library that analyzes your Python codebase to discover where functions, classes, methods, and modules are used. It then automatically updates their docstrings with a clear "Used in:" section, providing valuable cross-references directly within your code.

## TLDR

uzpy helps you understand and document code relationships by:

1. **Scanning** your Python files to find function/class definitions
2. **Analyzing** where each construct is used throughout your codebase  
3. **Updating** docstrings with "Used in:" sections automatically
4. **Providing** fast, cached analysis with multiple analyzer backends

**Quick start:**
```bash
uv pip install uzpy
uzpy run --edit src/ --ref . --safe
```

## Quick Example

Before uzpy:
```python
def calculate_metrics(data):
    """Calculate various metrics from data."""
    # implementation...
```

After uzpy:
```python
def calculate_metrics(data):
    """
    Calculate various metrics from data.
    
    Used in:
    - src/reports/generator.py
    - src/analysis/dashboard.py  
    - tests/test_metrics.py
    """
    # implementation...
```
