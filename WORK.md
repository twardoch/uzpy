## Completed Tasks

### Fixed Python Syntax Corruption Issue

The main issue was that uzpy would corrupt valid Python syntax when run on source code containing complex docstring patterns, particularly:
- Triple quotes within docstrings
- Nested quote patterns
- Escaped quotes

### Root Cause

The original `LibCSTModifier` was using simple string concatenation to rebuild docstrings:
```python
return f"{quote_char}{updated_content}{quote_char}"
```

This approach failed when `updated_content` contained the same quote characters, creating invalid syntax like:
```python
"""This has """ + """nested quotes.""""""  # Invalid Python!
```

### Solution Implemented

1. **Created SafeDocstringModifier** - A new corruption-resistant modifier with:
   - Intelligent quote detection that chooses the safest quote style
   - Proper escaping when necessary
   - Pre and post-modification syntax validation
   - Automatic rollback on corruption detection

2. **Added Safety Features**:
   - Syntax validation using `ast.parse()` before and after modifications
   - File backup before modification (optional)
   - Dry-run mode for previewing changes
   - Detailed logging of skipped files

3. **Enhanced Quote Handling**:
   - Smart selection of quote style based on content
   - Support for all quote types: """, ''', ", '
   - Proper handling of escaped quotes
   - Raw string support when appropriate

4. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - `test_corruption_prevention.py` - Edge case tests
   - `test_self_modification.py` - Regression tests
   - `test_safe_integration.py` - Full integration tests

5. **CLI Integration**:
   - Added `--safe` flag to use the safe modifier
   - Updated documentation with examples
   - Maintained backward compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Consider making safe mode the default after more testing
2. Add performance benchmarks comparing safe vs standard modifier
3. Consider adding a configuration option to always use safe mode
4. Add more edge case tests as they're discovered
