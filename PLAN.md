# uzpy Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

uzpy is a Python tool that automatically tracks where constructs (functions, classes, methods) are used across codebases and updates their docstrings with usage information. It uses a three-phase pipeline combining Tree-sitter for parsing, Rope and Jedi for reference finding, and LibCST for code modification.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CLI Interface** - Fire-based CLI with Rich formatting
2. **File Discovery** - Efficient Python file discovery with gitignore support
3. **Tree-sitter Parser** - Fast AST parsing with error recovery
4. **Hybrid Analyzer** - Combines Rope and Jedi for optimal reference finding
5. **LibCST Modifier** - Safe docstring modification preserving formatting

### Technology Stack

- **Tree-sitter**: Fast, incremental parsing with excellent error recovery
- **Rope**: Accurate cross-file reference finding and refactoring support
- **Jedi**: Fast symbol resolution with excellent caching
- **LibCST**: Concrete syntax tree for safe code modification
- **Fire**: Automatic CLI generation
- **Rich**: Beautiful terminal output
- **Loguru**: Structured logging

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards
- Python 3.11+ with modern type hints
- Ruff for linting and formatting
- Pytest for testing
- 100% type coverage with mypy
- Comprehensive docstrings

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches for development
- Pull requests with CI checks
- Semantic versioning
- Automated releases

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Example project validation

## Key Design Decisions

### Parser Choice: Tree-sitter
- **Pros**: Fast, incremental, excellent error recovery
- **Cons**: More complex setup than ast module
- **Decision**: Speed and robustness for large codebases justified complexity

### Analyzer Strategy: Hybrid Rope + Jedi
- **Rope**: Accurate but slower for complex analysis
- **Jedi**: Fast but may miss edge cases
- **Hybrid**: Use Jedi first, Rope for verification and complex cases

### Modification Tool: LibCST
- **Pros**: Preserves formatting, comments, and exact syntax
- **Cons**: More complex than ast modifications
- **Decision**: Professional tool requires preserving code style

## Current Status

### Completed (v0.1.0)
- Full CLI interface with beautiful output
- Efficient file discovery system
- Complete Tree-sitter parser integration
- Hybrid Rope/Jedi analyzer
- Code quality tools and testing framework

### Working Demo
```bash
uzpy run --edit src/ --dry-run --verbose
```

Shows discovered files, parsed constructs, and analysis summary.

### Next Milestones
1. **v0.2.0**: LibCST docstring modification
2. **v0.3.0**: Complete testing and polish
3. **v1.0.0**: Production-ready release

## Development Environment

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- uv for dependency management
- Tree-sitter Python bindings
- Development tools (ruff, pytest, mypy)

### Setup
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd uzpy
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .[dev,test]
```

### Testing
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
uzpy run --edit . --dry-run
```
