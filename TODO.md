## ✅ Fixed: Closing Quote Indentation

**Issue**: The closing `"""` in docstrings was not properly indented.

**Before**:
```python
    def __init__(self, project_path: Path):
        """
        Initialize the hybrid analyzer.

        Args:
            project_path: Root directory of the project to analyze

        Used in:
        - analyzer/hybrid_analyzer.py
"""  # ❌ No indentation
```

**After**: 
```python
    def __init__(self, project_path: Path):
        """
        Initialize the hybrid analyzer.

        Args:
            project_path: Root directory of the project to analyze

        Used in:
        - analyzer/hybrid_analyzer.py
        """  # ✅ Properly indented with 8 spaces
```

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced `_update_docstring_content()` to detect base indentation from existing docstrings
- Added proper indentation to closing triple quotes (`"""`) based on the context
- Updated `_create_new_docstring()` to handle indentation for new docstrings
- Tested with functions, classes, and methods at different nesting levels

## 🎯 Current Status: COMPLETE

All docstring formatting issues have been resolved:

- ✅ **Content indentation**: Matches existing docstring style
- ✅ **Closing quote indentation**: Properly aligned with function/class/method body
- ✅ **Relative paths**: Calculated from reference directory  
- ✅ **Extra newlines**: Added for proper spacing
- ✅ **Path deduplication**: No duplicate entries

The tool now produces perfectly formatted docstrings that maintain the original code style! 🚀
