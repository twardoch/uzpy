# TODO 

Read `PLAN.md` and implement the changes and improvements. Don’t remove any existing package integrations, just add more integrations as per `PLAN.md`! 

Don't ask me questions, just implement, and keep working. Once you’ve written code, say "Wait, but..." and continue thinking and working.
