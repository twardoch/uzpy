# temporal-alignment-system

Based on the provided specification, there does not appear to be any explicit temporal alignment system or Dynamic Time Warping implementation documented. The specification focuses on code analysis tools and Python construct tracking rather than video synchronization or temporal alignment.

The closest related functionality appears in the pipeline system (`src/uzpy/pipeline.py`), which implements a three-phase processing approach:

1. Parsing and Indexing Phase
2. Cross-Reference Finding Phase  
3. Docstring Modification Phase

However, this pipeline is focused on code analysis rather than temporal alignment. There is no explicit DTW or video synchronization logic documented in the provided specification.

Relevant file paths:
- `src/uzpy/pipeline.py`
