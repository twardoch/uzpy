# frame-fingerprinting-algorithm

The provided specification does not contain direct information about frame fingerprinting algorithms or perceptual hashing implementations. While the source materials cover extensive details about code analysis and parsing, they do not address frame fingerprinting functionality.

The closest related functionality appears to be in the analyzer components:

### Code Analysis Pipeline
- Location: `src/uzpy/analyzer/hybrid_analyzer.py`
- Implements a hybrid analysis approach for code pattern recognition
- Uses pattern matching and symbol resolution for identifying code constructs

### Parser Implementation 
- Location: `src/uzpy/parser/tree_sitter_parser.py`
- Provides parsing capabilities that could potentially be adapted for frame analysis
- Includes pattern matching functionality using Tree-sitter queries

While these components provide a foundation for pattern analysis, they are not currently implemented for frame fingerprinting or perceptual hashing purposes.
