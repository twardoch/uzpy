# spatial-alignment-system

The specification does not directly address a spatial alignment system or template matching functionality. While the codebase contains analyzers and pipelines, they are focused on Python code analysis rather than spatial/video processing.

The closest related components are:
- The hybrid analysis system combining multiple tools (Rope and Jedi) for code reference tracking
- Pipeline processing for sequential operations
- Discovery mechanisms for traversing and processing files

However, these components do not implement spatial alignment or video template matching capabilities.

Business Logic Score: 0 (No spatial alignment functionality documented)
