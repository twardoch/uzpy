# spatial-alignment-system

Based on the provided specification, there is very limited direct information about the spatial alignment system. However, the following high-level structure can be documented:

### Analyzer Components

The project includes analyzer components that may relate to spatial alignment:

- Hybrid analysis approach for tracking and correlating elements
- Pattern detection and position resolution capabilities

File path: `src/uzpy/analyzer/hybrid_analyzer.py`

### Discovery System 

A discovery mechanism exists that could support spatial element identification:

- Custom discovery logic for identifying and categorizing elements
- Configurable pattern matching and exclusion rules

File path: `src/uzpy/discovery.py`

### Validation Framework

The system includes validation capabilities that may apply to spatial alignment:

- Custom validation rules for enforcing spatial constraints
- Pattern-based validation for element positioning

File path: `src/uzpy/validator.py`

While the specification does not provide detailed information specifically about spatial alignment algorithms or template matching, these structural components suggest the foundation for such functionality exists within the system architecture.
