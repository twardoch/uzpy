# video-processing-pipeline

Based on the provided specification, there does not appear to be any dedicated video processing pipeline functionality documented. While the specification describes a robust pipeline for Python code analysis including parsing, analysis, and modification phases, it does not contain any components specifically related to:

- Video frame processing
- Background adaptation
- Audio synchronization
- Frame sampling
- Video stream handling

The existing pipeline architecture could potentially be extended to support video processing, but the current implementation focuses entirely on Python code analysis and docstring management.

The specification details a four-phase pipeline consisting of:
1. Discovery Phase (finding Python files)
2. Parsing Phase (code construct extraction)
3. Analysis Phase (usage pattern detection)
4. Modification Phase (docstring updates)

None of these phases contain video-specific processing components.
