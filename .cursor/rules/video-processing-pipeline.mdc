# video-processing-pipeline

After reviewing the provided specification, I do not see any specific video processing pipeline implementation details or related business logic documented. The specification focuses on code analysis tooling (uzpy) rather than video processing functionality.

The available specification does not contain information about:
- Frame sampling logic
- Background adaptation algorithms  
- Audio synchronization methods
- Video pipeline architecture

A new specification would need to be created to document these video processing aspects.
